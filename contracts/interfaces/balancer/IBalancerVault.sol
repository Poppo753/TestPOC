 * @dev Balancer Vault address is the same on all chains: 0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - 0% fee flash loans (completely free!)
 * - Multi-token flash loans in single transaction
 * - Large liquidity pool (billions of dollars)
 * 
 * USAGE:
 * 1. Contract calls flashLoan() with desired tokens/amounts
 * 2. Vault transfers tokens to recipient
 * 3. Vault calls receiveFlashLoan() on recipient
 * 4. Recipient must repay exact amounts before function returns
 * 5. If not repaid, entire transaction reverts
